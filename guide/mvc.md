MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used in software development to separate an application into three interconnected components. This separation helps organize the code, making it more manageable and scalable. Here's a breakdown:

1. Model
What it is: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
Responsibilities:
Handles data storage, retrieval, and any business rules or calculations.
Interacts with the database, web services, or any external APIs.
Example: In an app for managing books, the Book model could represent a book's details like title, author, and price, and handle how books are stored or retrieved from a database.
2. View
What it is: The user interface (UI) that the user interacts with.
Responsibilities:
Displays data from the model to the user.
Receives user input and sends it to the controller.
Example: In the book management app, the view would be the form that displays the list of books or lets a user enter a new book’s details.
3. Controller
What it is: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View.
Responsibilities:
Handles user input, processes it (often with the help of the model), and updates the view accordingly.
Example: When the user submits a form to add a new book, the controller takes the input, tells the model to save the data, and then refreshes the view to show the updated list of books.
How MVC works together:
User interaction: The user interacts with the View (e.g., filling a form).
Controller action: The Controller processes the input (e.g., sends the data to the Model).
Model updates: The Model updates its data based on the Controller's request.
View refreshes: The View is updated to reflect the new or changed data from the Model.
This separation allows for better organization. For example, if you change how data is stored (Model), you don't need to change the View. Similarly, if you update the UI (View), it won’t affect the logic in the Controller.
